# Responsive Club Project

## Introduction

This is my project that focuses heavily on creating a responsive website, such as making sure that the website works correctly on both monitors and mobile phones

### Technologies

HTML and CSS were used exclusively for this project

### Comments
I likely need to adjust the media queries further to really tailor the end result, I am having some trouble with the quotation section not quite resizing as intended.
